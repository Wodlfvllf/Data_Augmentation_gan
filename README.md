# Data_Augmentation_gan
## Overview

This project focuses on frame interpolation using a convolutional neural network (CNN) for video processing. The goal is to predict intermediate frames between two consecutive frames in a video sequence, enhancing the smoothness of motion.

## Project Structure

- `Frame_interpolation.py`: Contains the definition of the frame interpolation model (`Data_Aug_Model`).
- `dataset.py`: Defines the custom dataset class (`Custom_Dataset`) for loading and preprocessing frames.
- `train.py`: Implements the training script for the frame interpolation model.
- `generate.py`: Demonstrates how to use the trained model to generate interpolated frames.
- `Pre_trained_Model/`: Directory to store pre-trained model weights.
- `Healthy/`: Directory containing input frames for training and testing.
- `results/`: Directory to store the output frames generated by the model.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- tqdm
- Pillow

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Training
-To train the frame interpolation model, run:
